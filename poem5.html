I mean it’s a real low point to realize that
I was her boyfriend
But I still got friend-zoned
By the girl who <i>liked me first</i>

I miss the girl who loved me 
and made plans of potential dates for sushi 
and the beach 
and SFMOMA
and baking 
and cooking together
and responded happily to me calling her wifey (after seeing her cook excellent dishes)
and tried to convince me to elope with her lol.
And even though all that long term stuff was just a fantasy 
and wouldn’t be real since she would be leaving after grad anyway, 
it was nice to imagine, and work towards making at least some of those 
dreams come true.

You know the sad part is realizing that we could’ve made this work.
If you were truly in love with me the way that I was in love with you,
Then you would’ve fought for me.
But you didn’t.
And that just means that I loved you more than you ever could.

I don’t get it
Am I not worth fighting for?
I would’ve done anything for you
And you wanted to break up instead of even try to work on us
I really thought we had something special
and maybe we did…
But I guess we’ll never know
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sergios.talks?lang=en" target="_blank">- @sergios.talks</a>, TikTok

It’s getting to a point where if she offered to get back together for 
a month before she left,
a week before she left,
if I even got to be with her for a single day,
I wouldn’t hesitate for even a second before I say “Yes”.
And I understand that maybe these feelings of desperation will eventually go away
but what if…
they don’t?
How long will the longing last?

I fear that because of this,
I’ll be even less likely to establish boundaries in future relationships
Because I have a consistent tendency to allow the other person 
To do whatever they want and treat me however they want
As long as they don’t break up with me
Because I can always convince myself
“Oh these are just some of the trials of being in a relationship”
For example, I saw a TikTok the other day that lead me to this thought:
"I always thought that being yelled at and called dumb and stupid by my SO 
is normal and expected bc I’ve made some mistake and deserve that kind of response. 
Is it not?”

I’ve had 2 important revelations in the past 24 hrs:
  1. No amount of blankets and pillows / no matter how hard I hug my comfy blanket  <br>     will it fill the hole in my heart, bc that is an internal pain that cannot be solved by external objects
  2. One of the reasons I would go to sleep so late is bc I never feel as excruciatingly lonely <br>      as I do when I’m in bed and going to sleep (or waking up). I found this out when <br>      I actually had a little anxiety and was consciously procrastinating going to bed <br>      so that I could postpone the feeling of being so alone.
          • It’s even possible that I was subconsciously putting off going to sleep <br>            until I was so tired that I could just knock out immediately <br>            bc that way I wouldn’t be spending any time thinking about her
