            Feb 15, 2021 
            One year ago today, we were at BB,
            which was the first time we were publicly 
            together as a couple, and 
            easily one of the best nights of my life.

“Hey, how are you doing?"

There’s nothing going on 
Just my brain keeps going on 
And it’s like mowing a lawn:
The sound drones on and on 

And I’m clenching my fists
To stop the outburst
But they notice, take risks
To just make it worse

Make fun of my anger
Push me off the stage
From the depths they'll uncover
The extent of my rage

Then they get scared when they see my face
And ask me “Oh what’s wrong?”
Don’t act so surprised, this is my head space
Come take a look at what’s going on

I want to sleep but the noise won’t stop
I want escape but my life feels locked
Distract myself, I scroll TikTok
Dark thoughts rush in, ignore the clock

I thought that I was healing
Turns out I've just stopped feeling
Cuz the process halts all progress
As I stare into the ceiling

There’s no time to be depressed
I’ve got to keep on moving
Keep grinding for my future
But it’s myself that I am losing

And it’s myself I should be choosing
But it’s myself I keep on bruising
It’s myself I keep abusing
Now I’m finding it amusing

This music I keep using
Break out my life that’s so confusing
Offered help, I keep refusing
Fuck alarms, I’ll just keep snoozing

Until I wake up in a daze
Hair is messy, eyes are glazed
Years have passed, and I’m amazed
This is not a fucking phase

And it’s not going away
No, now it’s here to stay
I think my mind decays
When I push my thoughts, delay

I’ve been alive but I’ve never lived
So what do I have to lose?
Haven’t felt that way since I was a kid
It’s not a hard choice to choose

It hurts me everyday
After losing her, once mine
But all I can say is that:

"I’m fine”
