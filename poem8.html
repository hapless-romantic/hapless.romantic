            Feb 15, 2021 
            One year ago today, we were at BB,
            which was the first time we were publicly 
            together as a couple, and 
            easily one of the best nights of my life.

      “Hey, how are you doing?"

      There’s nothing going on 
      Just my brain keeps going on 
      And it’s like mowing a lawn:
      The sound drones on and on 
      
      And I’m clenching my fists
      To stop the outburst
      But they notice, take risks
      To just make it worse
      
      Make fun of my anger
      Push me off the stage
      From the depths they'll uncover
      The extent of my rage
      
      Then they get scared when they see my face
      And ask me “Oh what’s wrong?”
      Don’t act so surprised, this is my head space
      Come take a look at what’s going on

      I want to sleep but the noise won’t stop
      I want escape but my life feels locked
      Distract myself, I scroll TikTok
      Dark thoughts rush in, ignore the clock
      
      I thought that I was healing
      Turns out I've just stopped feeling
      Cuz the process halts all progress
      As I stare into the ceiling

      There’s no time to be depressed
      I’ve got to keep on moving
      Keep grinding for my future
      But it’s myself that I am losing

      And it’s myself I should be choosing
      But it’s myself I keep on bruising
      It’s myself I keep abusing
      Now I’m finding it amusing
      
      This music I keep using
      Break out my life that’s so confusing
      Offered help, I keep refusing
      Fuck alarms, I’ll just keep snoozing
      
      Until I wake up in a daze
      Hair is messy, eyes are glazed
      Years have passed, and I’m amazed
      This is not a fucking phase
      
      And it’s not going away
      No, now it’s here to stay
      I think my mind decays
      When I push my thoughts, delay
      
      I’ve been alive but I’ve never lived
      So what do I have to lose?
      Haven’t felt that way since I was a kid
      It’s not a hard choice to choose
      
      It hurts me everyday
      After losing her, once mine
      But all I can say is that:
       
      "I’m fine”
