            One year ago today was the last time I was
            with her before everything changed.

    <pre>
I don't think there’s a “right” person 
Or someone who’s “the one”
All that matters is effort put in
To not let us come undone

-----------------------------------

I was hoping you’d prove me wrong but I guess that I was right
I was put here as a joke to just get lost in the dark night
With all this love to give
That I can’t show anybody
Brimming creativity
Learned all my tricks from TV
Haven’t reached my capacity
Still got so much up my sleeve
Then she comes, matches my speed
I’m amazed, I fall, don’t want her to leave
But they all do that eventually...

Now you’re listening to songs playing you the victim
Gave all his love to you and still you kicked him
You should have picked him 
Never tricked him
Breaking daily, there’s no way to fix him
And you have the audacity
To try and replace me
You get yourself a mini me
After breaking down the realest me

I’m trying my hardest to not become toxic
The feeling come right to my door and then knocks it
It’s easy, be rude and make the love hurt
Hide all my pain then yell in my shirt

----------------------------------

Everything means nothing 
If it’s not with you
And I know I sound dramatic
But I know I have to have it
The feelings that I’m feeling
Disappeared when I had you

----------------------------------

It was getting hard? 
Please, you don’t know how I tried
Show you that I’m happy, though you’re not by my side
And we were, we were fine, if only you'd let me inside
We could’ve worked through it all, if you’d opened up 
Your mind

----------------------------------

I don’t want to move past our memories 
Because no matter how much you change
And how far away you move
I’ll have those good times close to me
I won’t forget or lose

----------------------------------

I don’t want to open up
Just for you to close on me

I’ll match your energy
Why won’t you match mine
You can say it’s not who you are
But you don’t even try

I want to be loved
The way I love you
I shouldn't have to ask
Expecting you do it too

I want you to challenge me
Not test my answer's wrong
Be with me, don’t judge me
Cuz we don’t have that long

To push me to grow more
And see the world as true
I know I’m asking for a lot so
I’d do the same for you

----------------------------------

I’m losing myself
Trying to hold onto you
Did you ever really care
About losing me too?

----------------------------------

<u>Words Unsaid</u>
thought you had to break my heart
just to get ahead
checked in with me a couple times
but now I’m left for dead
there’s no more tears now left to shed
love letters I can shred
for months you went and led
me on, though now you’ve gone and fled
no matter how i pled
it didn’t matter what i said
i’m lost for life, i’m seeing red
my patience has been spread
i’m hanging on by just a thread
feeling betrayed and misled
your true intentions I misread
fuck these feelings, I’m going to bed
