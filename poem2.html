    <pre>
      Keep talking to me like we're still just friends 
    Don't act like it wasn’t you wanting us to end
    
    Asking me questions like “Can friends still flirt?”
    How could you say that?? Do you know how much you hurt
    Me when you said that we weren’t going to work
    My face stayed calm but my heart went berserk
    
    I remember the girl who loved me
    Smiled when I was around
    That day you just looked away
    She was nowhere to be found
    And then you tore our love in two 
    I didn’t make a sound
    My face was blank but thoughts kept racing
    “Bury me in the ground"
    
    You said we couldn’t be together 
    But you're not acting it
    Still texting me cute messages
    Don’t be a hypocrite
    
    It’s like you just don't want the label
    But you still want my love
    Without the real thing, I’m not able
    To give you me, but part of
    
    Now I'm confused: 
    You want me or you don't?
    Don’t play with me like this
    Stop blowing up my phone
    
    Said you like the way I smell, 
    I'd wear it constantly,
    So in2u, now life is hell
    I’m cologne without the C
    
    You never meant to hurt me, but my trust for you is shrinking
    Since the day you said we’re done, my heart has kept on sinking
    Due to my own choices, I can’t stop these thoughts by drinking
    Hoping that you’ll come around, but that’s just wishful thinking
    
    I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the person that you wanted
    All our old pictures together
    Bring memories now haunted
    I want you back (I always will) but soon I might submit
    I don’t think I’ll find happiness in the place that I lost it
    
    Your friends said to never hurt you
    I guess I took that shit to heart
    Of all the pain I went through
    I made sure you felt no part
    
    Now I’m adrift on a plank of your love
    Floating aimlessly, cloudy skies up above
    While the bottomless ocean tries to pull me under
    Trying not to drown but I hear the thunder
    
    I feel it coming, the endless downpour 
    Memories of you, but I always want more
    I should forget; I can't help but adore
    You who made my poor heart soar
    
    I see our love starting to fade
    Exploding like a slow grenade
    You wanted my heart, now you’ve thrown it away
    Stop calling me that, I’m not your anbae
    
    Telling me I look nice, girl you’d better think twice
    Don’t try to entice me to make the sacrifice
    Already fell for you once, and I paid the price
    I’m still fixing my heart, now it’s cold as ice
    ... 
    I wanna say I’m getting over you
    But I know that’s still a lie
    I think of all the times I left
    You’d make it hard to say goodbye
    
    Maybe if I’d responded quicker
    Maybe if I hadn’t pushed those plans
    Maybe then I wouldn’t be so bitter
    Maybe then I’d still be your man
    
    You deserve the world and more,
    If I could I would restart
    Make sure to do everything right
    Why do good things fall apart?
