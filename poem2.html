    <pre>
Keep talking to me like we're still just friends 
Don't act like it wasn’t you wanting us to end

Asking me questions like “Can friends still flirt?”
How could you say that?? Do you know how much you hurt
Me when you said that we weren’t going to work
My face stayed calm but my heart went berserk

I remember the girl who loved me
Smiled when I was around
That day you just looked away
She was nowhere to be found
And then you tore our love in two 
I didn’t make a sound
My face was blank but thoughts kept racing
“Bury me in the ground"

You said we couldn’t be together 
But you're not acting it
Still texting me cute messages
Don’t be a hypocrite

It’s like you just don't want the label
But you still want my love
Without the real thing, I’m not able
To give you me, but part of

Now I'm confused: 
You want me or you don't?
Don’t play with me like this
Stop blowing up my phone

Said you like the way I smell, 
I'd wear it constantly,
So in2u, now life is hell
I’m cologne without the C

You never meant to hurt me, but my trust for you is shrinking
Since the day you said we’re done, my heart has kept on sinking
Due to my own choices, I can’t stop these thoughts by drinking
Hoping that you’ll come around, but that’s just wishful thinking

I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the person that you wanted
All our old pictures together
Bring memories now haunted
I want you back (I always will) but soon I might submit
I don’t think I’ll find happiness in the place that I lost it

Your friends said to never hurt you
I guess I took that shit to heart
Of all the pain I went through
I made sure you felt no part

Now I’m adrift on a plank of your love
Floating aimlessly, cloudy skies up above
While the bottomless ocean tries to pull me under
Trying not to drown but I hear the thunder

I feel it coming, the endless downpour 
Memories of you, but I always want more
I should forget; I can't help but adore
You who made my poor heart soar

I see our love starting to fade
Exploding like a slow grenade
You wanted my heart, now you’ve thrown it away
Stop calling me that, I’m not your anbae

Telling me I look nice, girl you’d better think twice
Don’t try to entice me to make the sacrifice
Already fell for you once, and I paid the price
I’m still fixing my heart, now it’s cold as ice
... 
I wanna say I’m getting over you
But I know that’s still a lie
I think of all the times I left
You’d make it hard to say goodbye

Maybe if I’d responded quicker
Maybe if I hadn’t pushed those plans
Maybe then I wouldn’t be so bitter
Maybe then I’d still be your man

You deserve the world and more,
If I could I would restart
Make sure to do everything right
Why do good things fall apart?
