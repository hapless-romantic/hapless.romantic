  <p class="poem"> 
    Keep talking to me like we're still just friends <br>
    Don't act like it wasn’t you wanting us to end<br>
    <br>
    Asking me questions like “Can friends still flirt?”<br>
    How could you say that?? Do you know how much you hurt<br>
    Me when you said that we weren’t going to work<br>
    My face stayed calm but my heart went berserk<br>
    <br>
    I remember the girl who loved me<br>
    Smiled when I was around<br>
    That day you just looked away<br>
    She was nowhere to be found<br>
    And then you tore our love in two <br>
    I didn’t make a sound<br>
    My face was blank but thoughts kept racing<br>
    “Bury me in the ground"<br>
    <br>
    You said we couldn’t be together <br>
    But you're not acting it<br>
    Still texting me cute messages<br>
    Don’t be a hypocrite<br>
    <br>
    It’s like you just don't want the label<br>
    But you still want my love<br>
    Without the real thing, I’m not able<br>
    To give you me, but part of<br>
    <br>
    Now I'm confused: <br>
    You want me or you don't?<br>
    Don’t play with me like this<br>
    Stop blowing up my phone<br>
    <br>
    Said you like the way I smell, <br>
    I'd wear it constantly,<br>
    So in2u, now life is hell<br>
    I’m cologne without the C<br>
    <br>
    You never meant to hurt me, but my trust for you is shrinking<br>
    Since the day you said we’re done, my heart has kept on sinking<br>
    Due to my own choices, I can’t stop these thoughts by drinking<br>
    Hoping that you’ll come around, but that’s just wishful thinking<br>
    <br>
    I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the person that you wanted<br>
    All our old pictures together<br>
    Bring memories now haunted<br>
    I want you back (I always will) but soon I might submit<br>
    I don’t think I’ll find happiness in the place that I lost it<br>
    <br>
    Your friends said to never hurt you<br>
    I guess I took that shit to heart<br>
    Of all the pain I went through<br>
    I made sure you felt no part<br>
    <br>
    Now I’m adrift on a plank of your love<br>
    Floating aimlessly, cloudy skies up above<br>
    While the bottomless ocean tries to pull me under<br>
    Trying not to drown but I hear the thunder<br>
    <br>
    I feel it coming, the endless downpour <br>
    Memories of you, but I always want more<br>
    I should forget; I can't help but adore<br>
    You who made my poor heart soar<br>
    <br>
    I see our love starting to fade<br>
    Exploding like a slow grenade<br>
    You wanted my heart, now you’ve thrown it away<br>
    Stop calling me that, I’m not your anbae<br>
    <br>
    Telling me I look nice, girl you’d better think twice<br>
    Don’t try to entice me to make the sacrifice<br>
    Already fell for you once, and I paid the price<br>
    I’m still fixing my heart, now it’s cold as ice<br>
    ... <br>
    I wanna say I’m getting over you<br>
    But I know that’s still a lie<br>
    I think of all the times I left<br>
    You’d make it hard to say goodbye<br>
    <br>
    Maybe if I’d responded quicker<br>
    Maybe if I hadn’t pushed those plans<br>
    Maybe then I wouldn’t be so bitter<br>
    Maybe then I’d still be your man<br>
    <br>
    You deserve the world and more,<br>
    If I could I would restart<br>
    Make sure to do everything right<br>
    Why do good things fall apart?<br>
