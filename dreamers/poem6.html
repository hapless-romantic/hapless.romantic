            be my girlfriend.

    <pre>
I lost my mind in quarantine
Ignored the signs, stared at the screen

It’s been 7 years since it started
And I’m still not getting better
Wonder when the pain will fade
I’m starting to think not ever

I keep it hidden behind a smile
Conceal the internal turmoil
Block out the thoughts and bury the feelings
Then lie to convince myself I’m healing

My trichotillomania is back and acting up
I should stop myself or wear a hood but idgaf
I’m pulling out the hairs from my beard and from my head
“It works to ease anxiety”, at least that’s what they said

I don’t know, it might be that, or maybe something different
Pause the chaos in my mind, the voices are vociferant
Sitting, introspecting, but the cost is I’m exhausted
Tell myself to “Stop, no more!”, the line is gone, I’ve crossed it

Sometimes it stings, sometimes it holds
Sometimes it lasts like a burning coal
I’m not scared, I know my threshold 
Cuz pain hits different when it’s pain you control 

Always stay closed with these scars I cover
Go through the day, dark thoughts still hover
Every time I feel good, think it lasts forever
Then I’m whipped, kicked back, feeling cold as December

Distorted self-image is killing my vision
Can’t open my eyes when my mind is a prison
I look in the mirror, I’m skinny but fat
Not proud of myself, can't do this or that

My mind keeps taking my heart on a ride
This hopeless romantic’s turned reckless tonight
His confidence shattered, he’s broken inside
His thoughts are all scattered, stay up till daylight

I don’t want to close my eyes
And wake up in a world so blind
They cheat, deceive, and fantasize
They’re chasing highs all of their lives

Their lifestyle is defiant
They’re not spending their time climbing
While I’m in my bedroom quiet
Dreaming of the day I’m flying

It’s not serious, not dangerous
I want to be adventurous
See people living; I'm jealous
Feel like a modern Sisyphus

Wake up, then eat
Work, don’t leave my seat
Stay up, then sleep
And next day, repeat

All the time, alone in my room
Just working to keep my mind off of you
Then you creep in my thoughts effortlessly
I spiral, memories spin endlessly

You’re pushing the limits of my sanity
The you in my head is all that I need
I’m losing my grip on reality
But it doesn’t matter, won’t help if I plead

I’ve tried to stay calm and reasonable
But I have my limits; not invincible
Quite the opposite, it’s hurting me constantly
That you seem alright almost instantly

But then I remember “Of course you’d be fine
You lost the love way back in July”
So it didn’t hurt you when you’d blindside
Fool me to think you’d never say “Goodbye”

When you came to me and fixed my frown
I thought you were a blessing
As time went by, you broke me down
Turns out you were just a lesson

Sometimes I wish that I did something wrong
At least there’s a reason to why you’re gone 
I could fix my mistake, you’d be back in my arms
Instead you just left and I’m feeling the harm

I think I get attached to almost anyone who listens
To what I’m thinking, what I’m saying, 
My eyes might start to glisten
Then I find out she lies to me
But it’s too late for that
I’d rather go through pain and suffer
Than go back to where I was at

I guess I’m not mad that you don’t want me
I’m mad at the times you would act like you do
And take advantage of that soft spot in me
Because you know I’ll always come back to you

What does it mean to be alive
If I waste away without a drive
The night will come as days pass by
I lie in bed and dream of the sky

I’m tired of making up reasons
As to why “I don’t deserve this
I haven’t worked hard enough
and I don’t have a purpose”

Because it only lasts for people
Who’ve worked hard to deserve it
And provide a useful service
Whose loss would surely be missed

But love can’t be as transactional 
As it seems in my mind
It’s emotional, illogical
Still I can’t seem to find

Something that lasts,
Something that’s real
Something that makes me
Want to live and really feel

But till then I’ll just keep working
With my love life on the shelf
Still hoping that I’ll find her
As I keep losing myself
