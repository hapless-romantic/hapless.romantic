  <p class="poem"> 
    <pre>
I feel so alone 
With nobody here to call my own
My heart got cut, I’m getting it sewn
I had one chance, and now it’s blown

I’m not mad at other couples
There’s no way that would be fair
But a couple weeks, come Christmastime
Love is in the air
And they’ll be together, looking comfy cozy
Happy with each other, smiles wide, cheeks rosy

It sucks cuz it’s right near cuffing season
That’s why it hurts, maybe that’s the reason
But in reality, your words were squeezin
My heart, it’s a hard truth I’ll have to ease in

And now I wear more layers;
Feels like a hug that never ends
I miss you so, I've sent out prayers
I don't want to be “just friends”

But it’s still not the same as your soft touch,
Every time you did, I’d feel so much
Sent waves through my body with just your fingers
Am I the only one whose love still lingers?

My confidence increased by being with you 
Building my self worth, seeing my value
And by the time we graduate, I’d believe in me too
And see myself the way that you do 

But that has since been ripped away
My mind is filled with clutter
Self-assured words conveyed
But now I start to stutter

I’m weeks behind on everything
I’m losing control of my mind
On fragments of us, 
In memories, I cling
Happiness and you seem intertwined

What do I do when I tried my best
And it’s still not enough to make you stay
Love you more or love you less?
Questions in my head pester everyday

I don’t know if I miss you anymore
I miss the person I thought you were
I miss the love I thought was sure
Now I don’t know life, I’m insecure 

They tell me not to worry, that I’ll find someone new
And replace all the memories I still have of you
But to erase is not so easy, I don't think they know
We weren’t just a scene, we were the whole damn show

Yet even in my own movie
I think that I’m an extra
On the side, an NPC
Stay quiet like a Tesla
The truth of our relationship came creeping like a Prius
I never would’ve thought that you would choose to go and leave us

I didn’t care that we weren’t totally ideal
All I wanted with you was something that's real
Four months ago, my heart did cartwheels
What did I do? Why’d you lose the appeal? 

Just 2 months gone since we were together
And since then I’m feeling under the weather
Know there’s no time that would make it better
Still, dark thoughts ruin my mind unfettered

Wake up every morning now just to remember
“Oh that's right she’s not mine anymore”
I want out of this nightmare, it’s only December
Getting out of bed is becoming a chore

The pain in my chest goes straight to my head
Hurts a little less now my heart’s turned to lead
These thoughts and emotions I wish I could sever
It’s hurting me daily, but I’m numb, so whatever

I opened my heart for you
But I opened it for pain
You put together the pieces
Just to shatter it again

Take my love and beat it down
Treat it like a tetherball
Pull me close and swing it round
Then push it back until I fall

How do I stop caring for you
After all the emotions you put me through
I thought you were a keeper, the one that’s true
I only wish I could have kept you

Who we were and who we are
Felt so close, now we’re so far
The entire time, 15 min away
Inside my mind, you’ll always stay

I’ve never been as happy as I was being with you
Just an underlying feeling - it was too good to be true

It’s bittersweet to know:
That every wave of grief 
I've struggled swimming through
Was a deeper layer of the love 
That I had grown for you

I’m trying to forget, but I wish you knew
All of the things I wanted to do
To make you smile, laugh and view
Me as someone worth giving love to

“I was always happier in times when you were near
With everyday we spent together, I had no real fears”
but now...

I’m afraid to go back out there
I’m afraid to open up
To show myself, my heart out bare
I could never just hookup

I’m afraid of showing that I care
I’m afraid of catching feelings
For me to love so deep, so rare
Is the real you revealing?

I’m afraid of being hurt
After giving out my heart
To see your face, your eyes avert
I start to fall apart

I’m afraid of feeling something real
That means I have something to lose
Someone who’s there or someone who feels
I want both, I don’t wanna choose

I’m afraid of being happy
As I sit here all alone
Show me how, I need somebody
Can’t do this on my own
