    <pre>
What if I overromanticise
Because in my eyes
You were the sunrise
Just your smile could light up the skies
And gave me such highs
I’d feel butterflies

I lost myself in the depths of your eyes
I really can’t lie, took me by surprise
Hope for the future, I’d fantasize
Should’ve expected that be our demise

Our love began to digitize
And we should’ve synchronized
Behind your screen, you jeopardized
Turns out your love became a disguise

Foolish to think I’d won the prize
Wish my time I’d maximized
Idealize, then idolize
This new you I can’t recognize

When I was with her, I felt myself thrive
When I was with her, I had found my drive
I found a future for which I should strive
I found a reason I'd want to survive

These past few months have been a nosedive
Without her now I feel so deprived
Ride down the highway, I'm pushing 95
Blank gaze on the road as I shift overdrive

I want to be clear, this isn’t a lie
Nothing else made me so glad being alive
Maybe it was a different kind of high
Honestly don’t know if I can revive 

Eventually I’ll prioritize
My thoughts inside will stabilize
My thoughts, emotions organized
Make clear my needs, won’t compromise

Only when I realize 
Only then will I rise
My pain, my anger analyzed
My values, morals I’ll revise

But for now I agonize
My emotions polarize
Miss you once, then I despise
Can’t choose a side, I’m paralyzed
