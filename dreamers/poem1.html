          Nov 1, 2020 
          This was the first poem I worked on 
          following the breakup. It's written to detail
          our love story: how I felt when we started
          and how I felt when we ended.

  <pre>
I’ve thought that you were beautiful for oh so many years 
Even in those times you didn't; I could see it clear
I was always happier in times when you were near
With every day we spent together, I had no real fears
And through the trying times we’d go on and persevere
I still don’t understand how it came to all these tears

Every other day, I’d make excuses and be late
To reach back home because with you, I’d always want to stay
The hole inside my heart was turning whole and got reshaped
As being in your arms was a wonderful escape

I’d have a lot on my mind, a lot on my plate
But even then I’d still try to make sure and make 
The time to spend with you and hear about your day
Because I loved the way you talked and I loved the way you’d say

How you were enjoying college, my heart began to race
As I watched your excitement, smile lighting up your face
Through your voice, your cheeks, your eyes, the delight,
It’s no surprise I fell for you on that September night

But yet I made no moves, I didn’t think that we were right
For each other. Compared to me, you were a beacon of light
You were so full of life, through my darkness you shone bright
If I hadn’t hesitated. . . 
Perhaps you’d still be mine tonight

2019 was a mess for me, you know as well as I do
In all the places I lost my way, I found myself with you
I showed my darkness to you, the madness in my brain
You were there for me, through the sunshine and the rain
I was so surprised that you still liked me; didn’t waver
There’s no other way to put it: you were my life saver

From all the stresses and the troubles of the classes I was taking
I hope you really loved me, I hope you weren’t faking
I keep thinking back on all the different ways I’d change the past
To treat you better and make sure 10/9 won't be our last

You’d say you're “wishy washy” 
And can't make up your mind
I’d always support your choices
Till my heart was on the line

I wish I could’ve stopped you, and told you, “Please wait!
We can work through this, we don’t have to separate"
But your mind was then made up, there was nothing I could say
My whole world came crashing down as I watched you walk away

But I don’t regret it for a second, we weren't a mistake
We were unique, unlike the others, a perfect snowflake
If only things were different, hand in hand we’d've stayed
It ended all too quick, I can’t help but feel betrayed

Fuck covid, fuck quarantine, that’s all that’s left to blame
And yet, my dear, through it all, I loved you just the same
But apparently you were falling, falling out of love
Thought of me as just a friend, was I not good enough?

You never ever told me the way that you’d been feeling
Until the very last day, your words, they left me reeling
All the love and trust I’d built, up with your name to support it
Why’d you have to go and take my heart and make me forfeit?

The prize of love is hard to get but damn have I been trying
To overcome the hardships just to find out you’d been lying
I couldn’t believe what you were saying, 
How could you forget to mention!?
Thought we were winning the 2 player game 
Only you had left the session

But I guess I have to learn to stop expecting me from you
So true, you never loved and cared the way that I did too
I was fine with that, since against the world, it would always be us two
We’d be together, now you’ve left, the hell am I to do?

Every time I saw you, you'd paint my blue heart red
Now every time I see your name, I think of things unsaid
I’ll always cherish memories of hugging you in bed
Of dates planned but never made, thoughts run circles in my head

You say I don’t deserve this, that I can do better
That doesn’t make a difference, I still want you forever
I try to
Put you out my mind when I’m falling asleep
I dream about you still, guess I loved you too deep

I know I’ve got to move on but it’s so hard to do
I try to get it back, I can’t. My heart belongs to you
So take it, shake it, rake it, break it, and make it up again
No matter how you hurt me I’ll stay with you till the end

[Jk, that’s so unhealthy, there’s no point to doing that
It will take time, but eventually, I’ll get my whole heart back
Well maybe not it all, she’s still so special to me,
Some will stay with her forever, I have to live and let be]
