            Aug 7, 2021 
            One year ago today, we met up for the first time
            since March for our 8 month anniversary and we
            were so happy to see each other and we had a
            really nice date and I couldn’t stop smiling all day

    <pre>
I wanted to fight for you, for us
Even when you kept giving me reasons not to
You offered me the opportunity to break up with you 
3 times
Because you thought some flaw of yours 
Was too big for me to overlook
The thought of breaking up never crossed my mind, 
Not even once, in 10 months.
I wonder how many times it crossed yours.

I’m in love with the ghost of you.
I guess I didn’t fall in love with you.
I walked into love with you, with my eyes wide open, 
Choosing to take every step along the way.
I never would've guessed that you would walk away.

I’m really tired of the phrase 
“You deserve better”
I heard it way to many times from you, far too many to count
Why couldn’t you just try to be that person that I deserve?
I worked to improve myself everyday to be a better person for you
I guess you just didn’t want to make that same effort for me

*after seeing her in an insta post, smiling with <i>him</i>*
I think part of me thought that 
If I wrote my grievances in my poems, 
You wouldn’t do them irl.
But reality continues to show me that 
You’re really not the same girl I fell in love with.
And it hurts so so much
Because you still look exactly the same.
And I have to keep telling myself that
When you smile, 
You aren’t smiling because of me anymore.

I’m not mad at the fact you didn’t want to be with me
I’m mad because you acted like you did,
Promised that you did
All the way up till the day you didn’t
And on that day you decided that we were done.

If I’m so important to you,
Why was it so easy to leave me?
July ‘20: i’ll make time, always
Oct ‘20: we’re both getting really busy!…
“Treat her like a priority and she’ll treat you like a king"
She was always my priority but was I just a fling?

Imagine where we’d be if you hadn’t broken up with me
I’ve spent the past 9+ months trying to recalibrate myself
— why did you do this to me —
“It’s not you, it’s me.” That’s sO unfair.
Because we were in this together and 
Just because it wasn’t working out for you doesn’t mean 
That I don’t get to have a say in it
You did give me a say, but only after you’d made up your mind so 
wHAT THE FUCK was I supposed to do other than agree with you 
And force myself to let you go.

You said we’re both getting really busy with all our schoolwork
But no one is ever too busy to put effort 
In a relationship that they care about
You were always a priority, I’d never push you aside
Although it seemed through our conversation,
I wasn’t from your side.

I have so much love to give
and out of my insecurity of never being good enough
I give as much care and attention as I can
and then you still leave me 
Because you think I’m too good for you
So what am I supposed to do? 
Love you less so that I’m not left?
And now I’m hating myself
Because I tried my best and it still wasn’t enough
What else could I have done?
