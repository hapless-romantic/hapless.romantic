            One year ago today,
            she told me she loved me.

    <pre>
What if I overromanticise
Because in my eyes
You were the sunrise
Just your smile could light up the skies
And gave me such highs
Iâ€™d feel butterflies

I lost myself in the depths of your eyes
I really canâ€™t lie, took me by surprise
Hope for the future, Iâ€™d fantasize
Shouldâ€™ve expected that be our demise

Our love began to digitize
And we shouldâ€™ve synchronized
Behind your screen, you jeopardized
Turns out your love became a disguise

Foolish to think Iâ€™d won the prize
Wish my time Iâ€™d maximized
Idealize, then idolize
This new you I canâ€™t recognize

When I was with her, I felt myself thrive
When I was with her, I had found my drive
I found a future for which I should strive
I found a reason I'd want to survive

These past few months have been a nosedive
Without her now I feel so deprived
Ride down the highway, I'm pushing 95
Blank gaze on the road as I shift overdrive

I want to be clear, this isnâ€™t a lie
Nothing else made me so glad being alive
Maybe it was a different kind of high
Honestly donâ€™t know if I can revive 

Eventually Iâ€™ll prioritize
My thoughts inside will stabilize
My thoughts, emotions organized
Make clear my needs, wonâ€™t compromise

Only when I realize 
Only then will I rise
My pain, my anger analyzed
My values, morals Iâ€™ll revise

But for now I agonize
My emotions polarize
Miss you once, then I despise
Canâ€™t choose a side, Iâ€™m paralyzed
