      Did you ever actually, truly love me? 
      Or did you just say it back because I said it first?
      I think you did love me, but not nearly as much as I loved you. 
      If you had, you never would have given me up so easily.
      
      Why did it happen
      that somewhere along the way –
      I can’t say when you stopped feeling it
      I don’t know when your love was real and when it wasn't
      Because you said it happened some time in July
      But until September end you were showing me “love" –
      When I wasn’t paying attention
      Because I thought we were secure
      You started to grow up and grow apart
      And the value that you had for me 
      And the love you wanted to receive
      Became meaningless and constricting
      My love and affection for you never faded
      I did the best that I could do
      Being stuck at home away from you
      Until thoughts of break-up in you invaded
      So yes, it was always about you
      With no regard for my thoughts and emotions
      Because it’s what yOU wanted
      And no consideration left for me
      You said you wanted to find what made you happy
      Clearly, it wasn’t me, but
      What about my happiness?
      What about my love?
      What about my life?
      What about me?
      
      You thought staying in a relationship would be a distraction
      I think staying in a relationship would be a supplement:
      A source of happiness, relatability, comfort,
      Something to look forward to,
      And ultimately something that makes life worth living.
      
      It sucks because 
      For 10 months I was happy
      For 7 weeks I was getting better
      For 5 days I had hope
      But I lost it all in a second
      
      It’s clear to see now that
      It wasn’t that you no longer
      Had time for a relationship;
      It was that you no longer
      Thought our relationship
      Was worth your time.
      
      I remember when you were telling me 
      That you wanted to break up, and I said 
      I might ghost you for some time, 
      And your face was all 🥺 .
      How ironic.
      First of all, how dare you be sad that 
      I might need to not talk to you for some time 
      To get a hold of myself.
      So much for “you’re my bEsT fRiEnD” stFU 
      Now you’re acting all like you never wanted me 
      Or my love in the first place.
      
      “I always get what I want”
      The fine print to that line is that 
      You will always get what you want, 
      Without considering how your actions 
      Affect the people around you. 
      So in your efforts to build yourself up, 
      You won’t even notice you’re breaking me down.
      
      Is it my fault that
      I listened and learned how to love you 
      But I didn’t know to tell you how to love me back
      But brushed it aside when you showed that 
      You didn’t want to learn how to love me back
      
      ----------------------------------

      Were you ever really mine?
      Was I ever really yours?
      Or was I waiting in a line
      And was it just my turn?
      
      Another week another phase
      Another rerun echo plays
      Of you calling out my name
      Laughing, smiling as you say
      
      “I miss you, I want to see you again
      In just a couple months, when quarantine will end
      I’ll always love you, and forever be your friend…”
      Broken promises and lies, I can’t comprehend
      
      Abandonment and trust issues
      Don’t want ‘em but I just miss you
      Don’t come too close, don’t go too far
      I’ll write your name among the stars
      
      At least you got what you wanted
      At least you’re happy now
      Still smell your scent, I feel haunted
      Defeated by lost vows
