    <pre>
      I feel so alone 
      With nobody here to call my own
      My heart got cut, I’m getting it sewn
      I had one chance, and now it’s blown
      
      I’m not mad at other couples
      There’s no way that would be fair
      But a couple weeks, come Christmastime
      Love is in the air
      And they’ll be together, looking comfy cozy
      Happy with each other, smiles wide, cheeks rosy
      
      It sucks cuz it’s right near cuffing season
      That’s why it hurts, maybe that’s the reason
      But in reality, your words were squeezin
      My heart, it’s a hard truth I’ll have to ease in
      
      And now I wear more layers;
      Feels like a hug that never ends
      I miss you so, I've sent out prayers
      I don't want to be “just friends”
      
      But it’s still not the same as your soft touch,
      Every time you did, I’d feel so much
      Sent waves through my body with just your fingers
      Am I the only one whose love still lingers?
      
      My confidence increased by being with you 
      Building my self worth, seeing my value
      And by the time we graduate, I’d believe in me too
      And see myself the way that you do 
      
      But that has since been ripped away
      My mind is filled with clutter
      Self-assured words conveyed
      But now I start to stutter
      
      I’m weeks behind on everything
      I’m losing control of my mind
      On fragments of us, 
      In memories, I cling
      Happiness and you seem intertwined
      
      What do I do when I tried my best
      And it’s still not enough to make you stay
      Love you more or love you less?
      Questions in my head pester everyday
      
      I don’t know if I miss you anymore
      I miss the person I thought you were
      I miss the love I thought was sure
      Now I don’t know life, I’m insecure 
      
      They tell me not to worry, that I’ll find someone new
      And replace all the memories I still have of you
      But to erase is not so easy, I don't think they know
      We weren’t just a scene, we were the whole damn show
      
      Yet even in my own movie
      I think that I’m an extra
      On the side, an NPC
      Stay quiet like a Tesla
      The truth of our relationship came creeping like a Prius
      I never would’ve thought that you would choose to go and leave us
      
      I didn’t care that we weren’t totally ideal
      All I wanted with you was something that's real
      Four months ago, my heart did cartwheels
      What did I do? Why’d you lose the appeal? 
      
      Just 2 months gone since we were together
      And since then I’m feeling under the weather
      Know there’s no time that would make it better
      Still, dark thoughts ruin my mind unfettered
    
      Wake up every morning now just to remember
      “Oh that's right she’s not mine anymore”
      I want out of this nightmare, it’s only December
      Getting out of bed is becoming a chore
      
      The pain in my chest goes straight to my head
      Hurts a little less now my heart’s turned to lead
      These thoughts and emotions I wish I could sever
      It’s hurting me daily, but I’m numb, so whatever
      
      I opened my heart for you
      But I opened it for pain
      You put together the pieces
      Just to shatter it again
      
      Take my love and beat it down
      Treat it like a tetherball
      Pull me close and swing it round
      Then push it back until I fall
      
      How do I stop caring for you
      After all the emotions you put me through
      I thought you were a keeper, the one that’s true
      I only wish I could have kept you
      
      Who we were and who we are
      Felt so close, now we’re so far
      The entire time, 15 min away
      Inside my mind, you’ll always stay
      
      I’ve never been as happy as I was being with you
      Just an underlying feeling - it was too good to be true
      
      It’s bittersweet to know:
      That every wave of grief 
      I've struggled swimming through
      Was a deeper layer of the love 
      That I had grown for you
      
      I’m trying to forget, but I wish you knew
      All of the things I wanted to do
      To make you smile, laugh and view
      Me as someone worth giving love to
      
      “I was always happier in times when you were near
      With everyday we spent together, I had no real fears”
      but now...
      
      I’m afraid to go back out there
      I’m afraid to open up
      To show myself, my heart out bare
      I could never just hookup
      
      I’m afraid of showing that I care
      I’m afraid of catching feelings
      For me to love so deep, so rare
      Is the real you revealing?
      
      I’m afraid of being hurt
      After giving out my heart
      To see your face, your eyes avert
      I start to fall apart
      
      I’m afraid of feeling something real
      That means I have something to lose
      Someone who’s there or someone who feels
      I want both, I don’t wanna choose
      
      I’m afraid of being happy
      As I sit here all alone
      Show me how, I need somebody
      Can’t do this on my own
