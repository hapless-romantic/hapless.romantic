  <p class="poem"> 
  I feel so alone <br>
  With nobody here to call my own<br>
  My heart got cut, I’m getting it sewn<br>
  I had one chance, and now it’s blown<br>
  <br>
  I’m not mad at other couples<br>
  There’s no way that would be fair<br>
  But a couple weeks, come Christmastime<br>
  Love is in the air<br>
  And they’ll be together, looking comfy cozy<br>
  Happy with each other, smiles wide, cheeks rosy<br>
  <br>
  It sucks cuz it’s right near cuffing season<br>
  That’s why it hurts, maybe that’s the reason<br>
  But in reality, your words were squeezin<br>
  My heart, it’s a hard truth I’ll have to ease in<br>
  <br>
  And now I wear more layers;<br>
  Feels like a hug that never ends<br>
  I miss you so, I've sent out prayers<br>
  I don't want to be “just friends”<br>
  <br>
  But it’s still not the same as your soft touch,<br>
  Every time you did, I’d feel so much<br>
  Sent waves through my body with just your fingers<br>
  Am I the only one whose love still lingers?<br>
  <br>
  My confidence increased by being with you <br>
  Building my self worth, seeing my value<br>
  And by the time we graduate, I’d believe in me too<br>
  And see myself the way that you do <br>
  <br>
  But that has since been ripped away<br>
  My mind is filled with clutter<br>
  Self-assured words conveyed<br>
  But now I start to stutter<br>
  <br>
  I’m weeks behind on everything<br>
  I’m losing control of my mind<br>
  On fragments of us, <br>
  In memories, I cling<br>
  Happiness and you seem intertwined<br>
  <br>
  What do I do when I tried my best<br>
  And it’s still not enough to make you stay<br>
  Love you more or love you less?<br>
  Questions in my head pester everyday<br>
  <br>
  I don’t know if I miss you anymore<br>
  I miss the person I thought you were<br>
  I miss the love I thought was sure<br>
  Now I don’t know life, I’m insecure <br>
  <br>
  They tell me not to worry, that I’ll find someone new<br>
  And replace all the memories I still have of you<br>
  But to erase is not so easy, I don't think they know<br>
  We weren’t just a scene, we were the whole damn show<br>
  <br>
  Yet even in my own movie<br>
  I think that I’m an extra<br>
  On the side, an NPC<br>
  Stay quiet like a Tesla<br>
  The truth of our relationship came creeping like a Prius<br>
  I never would’ve thought that you would choose to go and leave us<br>
  <br>
  I didn’t care that we weren’t totally ideal<br>
  All I wanted with you was something that's real<br>
  Four months ago, my heart did cartwheels<br>
  What did I do? Why’d you lose the appeal? <br>
  <br>
  Just 2 months gone since we were together<br>
  And since then I’m feeling under the weather<br>
  Know there’s no time that would make it better<br>
  Still, dark thoughts ruin my mind unfettered<br>

  Wake up every morning now just to remember<br>
  “Oh that's right she’s not mine anymore”<br>
  I want out of this nightmare, it’s only December<br>
  Getting out of bed is becoming a chore<br>
  <br>
  The pain in my chest goes straight to my head<br>
  Hurts a little less now my heart’s turned to lead<br>
  These thoughts and emotions I wish I could sever<br>
  It’s hurting me daily, but I’m numb, so whatever<br>
  <br>
  I opened my heart for you<br>
  But I opened it for pain<br>
  You put together the pieces<br>
  Just to shatter it again<br>
  <br>
  Take my love and beat it down<br>
  Treat it like a tetherball<br>
  Pull me close and swing it round<br>
  Then push it back until I fall<br>
  <br>
  How do I stop caring for you<br>
  After all the emotions you put me through<br>
  I thought you were a keeper, the one that’s true<br>
  I only wish I could have kept you<br>
  <br>
  Who we were and who we are<br>
  Felt so close, now we’re so far<br>
  The entire time, 15 min away<br>
  Inside my mind, you’ll always stay<br>
  <br>
  I’ve never been as happy as I was being with you<br>
  Just an underlying feeling - it was too good to be true<br>
  <br>
  It’s bittersweet to know:<br>
  That every wave of grief <br>
  I've struggled swimming through<br>
  Was a deeper layer of the love <br>
  That I had grown for you<br>
  <br>
  I’m trying to forget, but I wish you knew<br>
  All of the things I wanted to do<br>
  To make you smile, laugh and view<br>
  Me as someone worth giving love to<br>
  <br>
  “I was always happier in times when you were near<br>
  With everyday we spent together, I had no real fears”<br>
  but now...<br>
  <br>
  I’m afraid to go back out there<br>
  I’m afraid to open up<br>
  To show myself, my heart out bare<br>
  I could never just hookup<br>
  <br>
  I’m afraid of showing that I care<br>
  I’m afraid of catching feelings<br>
  For me to love so deep, so rare<br>
  Is the real you revealing?<br>
  <br>
  I’m afraid of being hurt<br>
  After giving out my heart<br>
  To see your face, your eyes avert<br>
  I start to fall apart<br>
  <br>
  I’m afraid of feeling something real<br>
  That means I have something to lose<br>
  Someone who’s there or someone who feels<br>
  I want both, I don’t wanna choose<br>
  <br>
  I’m afraid of being happy<br>
  As I sit here all alone<br>
  Show me how, I need somebody<br>
  Can’t do this on my own<br>
