    <pre>
      I lost my mind in quarantine
      Ignored the signs, stared at the screen
      
      It’s been 7 years since it started
      And I’m still not getting better
      Wonder when the pain will fade
      I’m starting to think not ever
      
      I keep it hidden behind a smile
      Conceal the internal turmoil
      Block out the thoughts and bury the feelings
      Then lie to convince myself I’m healing
      
      My trichotillomania is back and acting up
      I should stop myself or wear a hood but idgaf
      I’m pulling out the hairs from my beard and from my head
      “It works to ease anxiety”, at least that’s what they said
      
      I don’t know, it might be that, or maybe something different
      Pause the chaos in my mind, the voices are vociferant
      Sitting, introspecting, but the cost is I’m exhausted
      Tell myself to “Stop, no more!”, the line is gone, I’ve crossed it
      
      Sometimes it stings, sometimes it holds
      Sometimes it lasts like a burning coal
      I’m not scared, I know my threshold 
      Cuz pain hits different when it’s pain you control 
      
      Always stay closed with these scars I cover
      Go through the day, dark thoughts still hover
      Every time I feel good, think it lasts forever
      Then I’m whipped, kicked back, feeling cold as December
      
      Distorted self-image is killing my vision
      Can’t open my eyes when my mind is a prison
      I look in the mirror, I’m skinny but fat
      Not proud of myself, can't do this or that
      
      My mind keeps taking my heart on a ride
      This hopeless romantic’s turned reckless tonight
      His confidence shattered, he’s broken inside
      His thoughts are all scattered, stay up till daylight
      
      I don’t want to close my eyes
      And wake up in a world so blind
      They cheat, deceive, and fantasize
      They’re chasing highs all of their lives
      
      Their lifestyle is defiant
      They’re not spending their time climbing
      While I’m in my bedroom quiet
      Dreaming of the day I’m flying
      
      It’s not serious, not dangerous
      I want to be adventurous
      See people living; I'm jealous
      Feel like a modern Sisyphus
      
      Wake up, then eat
      Work, don’t leave my seat
      Stay up, then sleep
      And next day, repeat
      
      All the time, alone in my room
      Just working to keep my mind off of you
      Then you creep in my thoughts effortlessly
      I spiral, memories spin endlessly
      
      You’re pushing the limits of my sanity
      The you in my head is all that I need
      I’m losing my grip on reality
      But it doesn’t matter, won’t help if I plead
      
      I’ve tried to stay calm and reasonable
      But I have my limits; not invincible
      Quite the opposite, it’s hurting me constantly
      That you seem alright almost instantly
      
      But then I remember “Of course you’d be fine
      You lost the love way back in July”
      So it didn’t hurt you when you’d blindside
      Fool me to think you’d never say “Goodbye”
      
      When you came to me and fixed my frown
      I thought you were a blessing
      As time went by, you broke me down
      Turns out you were just a lesson
      
      Sometimes I wish that I did something wrong
      At least there’s a reason to why you’re gone 
      I could fix my mistake, you’d be back in my arms
      Instead you just left and I’m feeling the harm
      
      I think I get attached to almost anyone who listens
      To what I’m thinking, what I’m saying, 
      My eyes might start to glisten
      Then I find out she lies to me
      But it’s too late for that
      I’d rather go through pain and suffer
      Than go back to where I was at
      
      I guess I’m not mad that you don’t want me
      I’m mad at the times you would act like you do
      And take advantage of that soft spot in me
      Because you know I’ll always come back to you
      
      What does it mean to be alive
      If I waste away without a drive
      The night will come as days pass by
      I lie in bed and dream of the sky
      
      I’m tired of making up reasons
      As to why “I don’t deserve this
      I haven’t worked hard enough
      and I don’t have a purpose”
      
      Because it only lasts for people
      Who’ve worked hard to deserve it
      And provide a useful service
      Whose loss would surely be missed
      
      But love can’t be as transactional 
      As it seems in my mind
      It’s emotional, illogical
      Still I can’t seem to find
      
      Something that lasts,
      Something that’s real
      Something that makes me
      Want to live and really feel
      
      But till then I’ll just keep working
      With my love life on the shelf
      Still hoping that I’ll find her 
      As I keep losing myself
