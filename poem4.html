    <pre>
    There was no warning, it was a total surprise!
    Just a few days prior, were you telling me lies??
    It was clear from your words you wanted to see me
    I felt the same, why did you deceive me?
    
    I don’t know what changed
    In a matter of 2 days
    But all of a sudden your mind was made
    In just a couple hours of meeting you razed
    The budding relationship we were trying to raise
    
    And I think that’s what hurts the most.
    That I had no idea what was coming,
    Until it was too late
    Our love was dying
    Was it meant to be fate?
    I know I was trying
    My hardest to make
    Our love keep on flying
    And go on more dates
    Now inside I’m crying
    My smile is fake
    You’re still occupying
    My mind, I can’t take
    Much more of this riot
    I’m starting to break
    Intensifying
    Why can’t it just stay
    QUIET!!!
    
    Why did you change?
    Why did you hide?
    I have to know the truth
    It’s eating me inside
    
    I’m with you in my dreams
    But I can’t see your face
    Your body’s there with me
    But your mind is far away
    
    Thanks for setting the bar so high
    I’ll compare everyone I meet with you
    And thanks for the trust issues I’ll now have
    If ever they say they love me too
    
    Thank you for giving me anxiety jerks 
    When I think about physical affection
    The constant insecurity, underneath it lurks
    Worried I make an emotional connection
    
    Because I don’t want to fall for someone
    Who might drop me with no warning
    Make me think I’ve hit a home run
    Till I’m mourning in the morning
    
    I don’t want to get over you
    I want to get you back
    But it’s hard to see you eye to eye
    When your mind is on one track
    
    When you said it that one night
    I felt my heart then crack
    You’re going on a one-way flight 
    That’s not cap that’s fact
    Fuck 408 and 510    
    And minimize contact
    You won’t be in these counties again
    You’re never coming back
    
    Across the country
    To New York City
    You’ll see the flashing lights
    Living your dream
    Fine I may seem
    But no I’m not alright
    
    And I’ll sit alone at night
    Cuz I’m falling from great heights
    There’s no hope in sight
    For my heart, I can’t ignite
    
    I see that you like all his posts
    Don’t even spend time to look at mine
    I wanted to fight "we were right"; almost
    As if you don't want to cross that line
    
    I hear it in songs hip-hop and rap
    To not be with someone of your zodiac
    I took the risk, and I paid it back
    You made your decision,
    Now you won’t retract
    
    I look into the mirror, can’t believe what I see
    “This used to be a face that would make her happy”
    Now if you and I met, you’d look past me
    Can’t imagine how it happened 
    You’re acting differently
    
    I wish you still loved me
    Or even just cared
    I could be everything you wanted
    But I think you’re just scared
    
    And I can’t say you never cared
    Cuz I remember when you did
    My thoughts and feelings I had aired
    But yours you kept and hid
    
    How could you break my heart this hard
    When I opened to you, let down my guard
    Gave you all of me, but I didn’t receive
    From you the energy, was I too naive?
    
    You’re so hard to read
    I don’t know what you need
    Are you sad or happy
    Now that you’re without me?
    
    Did you always want to leave?
    You’re the reason that my chest heaves
    You’re the reason I still grieve
    I’m falling like these autumn leaves
    
    I might be slipping into delusion
    About what we really were
    Was I ever truly yours?
    Or was it just my turn?
    
    At a certain point, I have to ask myself: 
    “Is it my fault that nothing works?
    Is it because I care too much?”
    I just want something that I can trust
    I just want someone who won’t give me up
    
    I was eager to grow up with you 
    While keeping the flame burning bright
    You never told me what you wanted 
    Until you doused our fire out that night
    
    What am I even supposed to do
    What if I never forget about you
    What if whenever I meet someone new
    I won’t fall for them cuz they’re just not you
    
    You were the closest thing to perfect
    Really thought that you were worth it
    But eventually they surfaced
    Your true feelings did disservice
    
    All that I ask is you give me
    Honesty,
    No deception
    Some decency? Some clarity? 
    Forget about affection
    Some empathy
    When you talk to me
    Some kindness in your eyes
    Put me at ease so
    Our memories won’t
    All just seem like lies
    
    Try as I might but I can’t vilify you 
    Still seem right despite how I try to
    Remember all the days that you did me wrong
    Bring back faded thoughts of nice times now gone
    
    You used to be mine, I used to be yours
    Just thinking ‘bout that hurts me to my core
    How happy we were then seems so surreal
    Told you I’m fine, but I still conceal
    
    Only my closest know how I feel
    All my love turned to pain and now I can’t heal
    And I won’t find someone else to whom to reveal
    My heart, I’m tired of this loveless ordeal
    <!-- But maybe it wasn’t true love, it wasn’t meant to be
    Maybe you weren’t meant to be the one who’s just for me
    That doesn’t mean that there is someone out there waiting for me
    Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t; I’ll have to wait and see -->
    So I guess this is goodbye
    To our good times and the bad
    To our inside jokes and quiet laughs 
    And ones we never had
    
    To all the what-ifs and plans half made
    Of picnics, together under the shade
    Of promises said “After quarantine…”
    I miss seeing your smile on my phone screen
