            One year ago today, we went on our first date
            to Christmas in the park.

    <pre>
There was no warning, it was a total surprise!
Just a few days prior, were you telling me lies??
It was clear from your words you wanted to see me
I felt the same, why did you deceive me?

I don’t know what changed
In a matter of 2 days
But all of a sudden your mind was made
In just a couple hours of meeting you razed
The budding relationship we were trying to raise

And I think that’s what hurts the most.
That I had no idea what was coming,
Until it was too late
Our love was dying
Was it meant to be fate?
I know I was trying
My hardest to make
Our love keep on flying
And go on more dates
Now inside I’m crying
My smile is fake
You’re still occupying
My mind, I can’t take
Much more of this riot
I’m starting to break
Intensifying
Why can’t it just stay
QUIET!!!

Why did you change?
Why did you hide?
I have to know the truth
It’s eating me inside

I’m with you in my dreams
But I can’t see your face
Your body’s there with me
But your mind is far away

Thanks for setting the bar so high
I’ll compare everyone I meet with you
And thanks for the trust issues I’ll now have
If ever they say they love me too

Thank you for giving me anxiety jerks 
When I think about physical affection
The constant insecurity, underneath it lurks
Worried I make an emotional connection

Because I don’t want to fall for someone
Who might drop me with no warning
Make me think I’ve hit a home run
Till I’m mourning in the morning

I don’t want to get over you
I want to get you back
But it’s hard to see you eye to eye
When your mind is on one track

When you said it that one night
I felt my heart then crack
You’re going on a one-way flight 
That’s not cap that’s fact
Fuck 408 and 510    
And minimize contact
You won’t be in these counties again
You’re never coming back

Across the country
To New York City
You’ll see the flashing lights
Living your dream
Fine I may seem
But no I’m not alright

And I’ll sit alone at night
Cuz I’m falling from great heights
There’s no hope in sight
For my heart, I can’t ignite

I see that you like all his posts
Don’t even spend time to look at mine
I wanted to fight "we were right"; almost
As if you don't want to cross that line

I hear it in songs hip-hop and rap
To not be with someone of your zodiac
I took the risk, and I paid it back
You made your decision,
Now you won’t retract

I look into the mirror, can’t believe what I see
“This used to be a face that would make her happy”
Now if you and I met, you’d look past me
Can’t imagine how it happened 
You’re acting differently

I wish you still loved me
Or even just cared
I could be everything you wanted
But I think you’re just scared

And I can’t say you never cared
Cuz I remember when you did
My thoughts and feelings I had aired
But yours you kept and hid

How could you break my heart this hard
When I opened to you, let down my guard
Gave you all of me, but I didn’t receive
From you the energy, was I too naive?

You’re so hard to read
I don’t know what you need
Are you sad or happy
Now that you’re without me?

Did you always want to leave?
You’re the reason that my chest heaves
You’re the reason I still grieve
I’m falling like these autumn leaves

I might be slipping into delusion
About what we really were
Was I ever truly yours?
Or was it just my turn?

At a certain point, I have to ask myself: 
“Is it my fault that nothing works?
Is it because I care too much?”
I just want something that I can trust
I just want someone who won’t give me up

I was eager to grow up with you 
While keeping the flame burning bright
You never told me what you wanted 
Until you doused our fire out that night

What am I even supposed to do
What if I never forget about you
What if whenever I meet someone new
I won’t fall for them cuz they’re just not you

You were the closest thing to perfect
Really thought that you were worth it
But eventually they surfaced
Your true feelings did disservice

All that I ask is you give me
Honesty,
No deception
Some decency? Some clarity? 
Forget about affection
Some empathy
When you talk to me
Some kindness in your eyes
Put me at ease so
Our memories won’t
All just seem like lies

Try as I might but I can’t vilify you 
Still seem right despite how I try to
Remember all the days that you did me wrong
Bring back faded thoughts of nice times now gone

You used to be mine, I used to be yours
Just thinking ‘bout that hurts me to my core
How happy we were then seems so surreal
Told you I’m fine, but I still conceal

Only my closest know how I feel
All my love turned to pain and now I can’t heal
And I won’t find someone else to whom to reveal
My heart, I’m tired of this loveless ordeal
<!-- But maybe it wasn’t true love, it wasn’t meant to be
Maybe you weren’t meant to be the one who’s just for me
That doesn’t mean that there is someone out there waiting for me
Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t; I’ll have to wait and see -->
So I guess this is goodbye
To our good times and the bad
To our inside jokes and quiet laughs 
And ones we never had

To all the what-ifs and plans half made
Of picnics, together under the shade
Of promises said “After quarantine…”
I miss seeing your smile on my phone screen
