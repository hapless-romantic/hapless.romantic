  <p class="poem"> 
  I’ve thought that you were beautiful for oh so many years <br>
  Even in those times you didn't; I could see it clear<br>
  I was always happier in times when you were near<br>
  With every day we spent together, I had no real fears<br>
  And through the trying times we’d go on and persevere<br>
  I still don’t understand how it came to all these tears<br>
  <br>
  Every other day, I’d make excuses and be late<br>
  To reach back home because with you, I’d always want to stay<br>
  The hole inside my heart was turning whole and got reshaped<br>
  As being in your arms was a wonderful escape<br>
  <br>
  I’d have a lot on my mind, a lot on my plate<br>
  But even then I’d still try to make sure and make <br>
  The time to spend with you and hear about your day<br>
  Because I loved the way you talked and I loved the way you’d say<br>
  How you were enjoying college, my heart began to race<br>
  As I watched your excitement, smile lighting up your face<br>
  Through your voice, your cheeks, your eyes, the delight,<br>
  It’s no surprise I fell for you on that September night<br>
  <br>
  But yet I made no moves, I didn’t think that we were right<br>
  For each other. Compared to me, you were a beacon of light<br>
  You were so full of life, through my darkness you shone bright<br>
  If I hadn’t hesitated. . . <br>
  Perhaps you’d still be mine tonight<br>

  2019 was a mess for me, you know as well as I do<br>
  In all the places I lost my way, I found myself with you<br>
  I showed my darkness to you, the madness in my brain<br>
  You were there for me, through the sunshine and the rain<br>
  I was so surprised that you still liked me; didn’t waver<br>
  There’s no other way to put it: you were my life saver<br>
  <br>
  From all the stresses and the troubles of the classes I was taking<br>
  I hope you really loved me, I hope you weren’t faking<br>
  I keep thinking back on all the different ways I’d change the past<br>
  To treat you better and make sure 10/9 won't be our last<br>
  <br>
  You’d say you're “wishy washy” <br>
  And can't make up your mind<br>
  I’d always support your choices<br>
  Till my heart was on the line<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could’ve stopped you, and told you, “Please wait!<br>
  We can work through this, we don’t have to separate"<br>
  But your mind was then made up, there was nothing I could say<br>
  My whole world came crashing down as I watched you walk away<br>
  <br>
  But I don’t regret it for a second, we weren't a mistake<br>
  We were unique, unlike the others, a perfect snowflake<br>
  If only things were different, hand in hand we’d've stayed<br>
  It ended all too quick, I can’t help but feel betrayed<br>
  <br>
  Fuck covid, fuck quarantine, that’s all that’s left to blame<br>
  And yet, my dear, through it all, I loved you just the same<br>
  But apparently you were falling, falling out of love<br>
  Thought of me as just a friend, was I not good enough?<br>
  <br>
  You never ever told me the way that you’d been feeling<br>
  Until the very last day, your words, they left me reeling<br>
  All the love and trust I’d built, up with your name to support it<br>
  Why’d you have to go and take my heart and make me forfeit<br>
  <br>
  The prize of love is hard to get but damn have I been trying<br>
  To overcome the hardships just to find out you’d been lying<br>
  I couldn’t believe what you were saying, <br>
  How could you forget to mention!?<br>
  Thought we were winning the 2 player game <br>
  Only you had left the session<br>
  <br>
  But I guess I have to learn to stop expecting me from you<br>
  So true, you never loved and cared the way that I did too<br>
  I was fine with that, since against the world, it would always be us two<br>
  We’d be together, now you’ve left, the hell am I to do?<br>
  Every time I saw you, you'd paint my blue heart red<br>
  Now every time I see your name, I think of things unsaid<br>
  I’ll always cherish memories of hugging you in bed<br>
  Of dates planned but never made, thoughts run circles in my head<br>
  <br>
  You say I don’t deserve this, that I can do better<br>
  That doesn’t make a difference, I still want you forever<br>
  I try to<br>
  Put you out my mind when I’m falling asleep<br>
  I dream about you still, guess I loved you too deep<br>
  <br>
  I know I’ve got to move on but it’s so hard to do<br>
  I try to get it back, I can’t. My heart belongs to you<br>
  So take it, shake it, rake it, break it, and make it up again<br>
  No matter how you hurt me I’ll stay with you till the end<br>
  <br>
  [Jk, that’s so unhealthy, there’s no point to doing that<br>
  It will take time, but sooner than later, I’ll get my whole heart back<br>
  Well maybe not it all, she’s still so special to me,<br>
  Some will stay with her forever, I have to live and let be]<br>
