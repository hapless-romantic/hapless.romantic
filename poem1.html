          Nov 1, 2020 
          This was the first poem I worked on 
          following the breakup. It's written to detail
          our love story: how I felt when we started
          and how I felt when we ended.

  <pre>
    I’ve thought that you were beautiful for oh so many years 
  Even in those times you didn't; I could see it clear
  I was always happier in times when you were near
  With every day we spent together, I had no real fears
  And through the trying times we’d go on and persevere
  I still don’t understand how it came to all these tears
  
  Every other day, I’d make excuses and be late
  To reach back home because with you, I’d always want to stay
  The hole inside my heart was turning whole and got reshaped
  As being in your arms was a wonderful escape
  
  I’d have a lot on my mind, a lot on my plate
  But even then I’d still try to make sure and make 
  The time to spend with you and hear about your day
  Because I loved the way you talked and I loved the way you’d say
  
  How you were enjoying college, my heart began to race
  As I watched your excitement, smile lighting up your face
  Through your voice, your cheeks, your eyes, the delight,
  It’s no surprise I fell for you on that September night
  
  But yet I made no moves, I didn’t think that we were right
  For each other. Compared to me, you were a beacon of light
  You were so full of life, through my darkness you shone bright
  If I hadn’t hesitated. . . 
  Perhaps you’d still be mine tonight

  2019 was a mess for me, you know as well as I do
  In all the places I lost my way, I found myself with you
  I showed my darkness to you, the madness in my brain
  You were there for me, through the sunshine and the rain
  I was so surprised that you still liked me; didn’t waver
  There’s no other way to put it: you were my life saver
  
  From all the stresses and the troubles of the classes I was taking
  I hope you really loved me, I hope you weren’t faking
  I keep thinking back on all the different ways I’d change the past
  To treat you better and make sure 10/9 won't be our last
  
  You’d say you're “wishy washy” 
  And can't make up your mind
  I’d always support your choices
  Till my heart was on the line
  
  I wish I could’ve stopped you, and told you, “Please wait!
  We can work through this, we don’t have to separate"
  But your mind was then made up, there was nothing I could say
  My whole world came crashing down as I watched you walk away
  
  But I don’t regret it for a second, we weren't a mistake
  We were unique, unlike the others, a perfect snowflake
  If only things were different, hand in hand we’d've stayed
  It ended all too quick, I can’t help but feel betrayed
  
  Fuck covid, fuck quarantine, that’s all that’s left to blame
  And yet, my dear, through it all, I loved you just the same
  But apparently you were falling, falling out of love
  Thought of me as just a friend, was I not good enough?
  
  You never ever told me the way that you’d been feeling
  Until the very last day, your words, they left me reeling
  All the love and trust I’d built, up with your name to support it
  Why’d you have to go and take my heart and make me forfeit
  
  The prize of love is hard to get but damn have I been trying
  To overcome the hardships just to find out you’d been lying
  I couldn’t believe what you were saying, 
  How could you forget to mention!?
  Thought we were winning the 2 player game 
  Only you had left the session
  
  But I guess I have to learn to stop expecting me from you
  So true, you never loved and cared the way that I did too
  I was fine with that, since against the world, it would always be us two
  We’d be together, now you’ve left, the hell am I to do?

  Every time I saw you, you'd paint my blue heart red
  Now every time I see your name, I think of things unsaid
  I’ll always cherish memories of hugging you in bed
  Of dates planned but never made, thoughts run circles in my head
  
  You say I don’t deserve this, that I can do better
  That doesn’t make a difference, I still want you forever
  I try to
  Put you out my mind when I’m falling asleep
  I dream about you still, guess I loved you too deep
  
  I know I’ve got to move on but it’s so hard to do
  I try to get it back, I can’t. My heart belongs to you
  So take it, shake it, rake it, break it, and make it up again
  No matter how you hurt me I’ll stay with you till the end
  
  [Jk, that’s so unhealthy, there’s no point to doing that
  It will take time, but sooner than later, I’ll get my whole heart back
  Well maybe not it all, she’s still so special to me,
  Some will stay with her forever, I have to live and let be]
