    <pre>
      You don’t know me anymore
      Now I’m not who you remember
      You can ghost me and ignore
      I lost myself just last December
      
      Cuz inside it’s all empty
      The old me’s gone and darkness sent me
      My heart has died but it’s still heavy
      Tread steadily when you see me
      
      But please don’t go away
      And please don’t come too close
      I can’t trust the words you seem to say
      And that’s what hurts the most
      
      And I can’t lose you, but I can’t choose you
      Come to me in my dreams, I’ll never refuse you
      It hurts but I’m fine I’m used to it
      It’s all in my head and I’m losing it
      
      I didn’t mind the chase
      Cuz I beat him in the race
      To see the smile on your face
      When I held you in embrace
      
      But you still talk to him. I <u>hate</u>
      That you’re still friends with him. Frustrated
      That you left me but you stay with him 
      He hurt you, why my pain again?
      
      I’m just a boy that’s broken
      So don’t play with my emotions
      Man, I feel the oxytocin
      When I’m in your arms, I’m hopin’
      
      That our time together never ends
      I finally found you, my girlfriend
      It feels so good, I play pretend
      They’re just daydreams, I wake again
      
      I don’t know how to be happy
      Without thinking of you
      I smile, start to laugh, then see
      You enter my mind’s room
      
      I’d give my days, my nights away
      To spend some time with you
      In thoughts you stay, so far away
      Spent talking to the moon
      
      You left me with all these endless emotions
      I’m drowning in my mind’s bottomless ocean
      I’m only happy when I’m not thinking
      My mind is empty, then I stop sinking
      
      I wish I could be heartless
      But that wouldn’t make it hurt less
      Gave you all of me, I’m worthless
      You were once my hope, I’m hopeless
      
      Temporary people cause permanent problems
      Give you months of pain with no way to solve em
      So when you leave this city, please also leave my head
      I can get on with my life since I know our love is dead
      
      Why’re you still in my mind
      I can’t seem to find
      A reason why you should control my life
      But here I still lie
      I can’t say goodbye
      To all these old photos, 
      Cut deep like a knife
      
      So don’t touch me
      Don’t hug me
      Stay away from me
      (Don’t leave)
      I’m sorry
      That I can’t be
      Someone that you need
      
      Do you think still about me
      Cuz I’m thinking that you don’t
      Keep hoping you’ll reach out to me
      No hoping, know you won’t
      
      My mind’s about to burst
      Cuz I’m stuck deep in the past
      You’ll always my first
      But I wish you were my last
      
      All that’s left to say are the texts I never sent
      Think about you every day, so you know you meant
      The world to me, how I wish we could go back to then
      I'm all done, now I don’t want to fall in love again
