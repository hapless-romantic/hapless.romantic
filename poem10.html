    <pre>
You don’t know me anymore
Now I’m not who you remember
You can ghost me and ignore
I lost myself just last December

Cuz inside it’s all empty
The old me’s gone and darkness sent me
My heart has died but it’s still heavy
Tread steadily when you see me

But please don’t go away
And please don’t come too close
I can’t trust the words you seem to say
And that’s what hurts the most

And I can’t lose you, but I can’t choose you
Come to me in my dreams, I’ll never refuse you
It hurts but I’m fine I’m used to it
It’s all in my head and I’m losing it

I didn’t mind the chase
Cuz I beat him in the race
To see the smile on your face
When I held you in embrace

But you still talk to him. I <u>hate</u>
That you’re still friends with him. Frustrated
That you left me but you stay with him 
He hurt you, why my pain again?

I’m just a boy that’s broken
So don’t play with my emotions
Man, I feel the oxytocin
When I’m in your arms, I’m hopin’

That our time together never ends
I finally found you, my girlfriend
It feels so good, I play pretend
They’re just daydreams, I wake again

I don’t know how to be happy
Without thinking of you
I smile, start to laugh, then see
You enter my mind’s room

I’d give my days, my nights away
To spend some time with you
In thoughts you stay, so far away
Spent talking to the moon

You left me with all these endless emotions
I’m drowning in my mind’s bottomless ocean
I’m only happy when I’m not thinking
My mind is empty, then I stop sinking

I wish I could be heartless
But that wouldn’t make it hurt less
Gave you all of me, I’m worthless
You were once my hope, I’m hopeless

Temporary people cause permanent problems
Give you months of pain with no way to solve em
So when you leave this city, please also leave my head
I can get on with my life since I know our love is dead

Why’re you still in my mind
I can’t seem to find
A reason why you should control my life
But here I still lie
I can’t say goodbye
To all these old photos, 
Cut deep like a knife

So don’t touch me
Don’t hug me
Stay away from me
(Don’t leave)
I’m sorry
That I can’t be
Someone that you need

Do you think still about me
Cuz I’m thinking that you don’t
Keep hoping you’ll reach out to me
No hoping, know you won’t

My mind’s about to burst
Cuz I’m stuck deep in the past
You’ll always my first
But I wish you were my last

All that’s left to say are the texts I never sent
Think about you every day, so you know you meant
The world to me, how I wish we could go back to then
I'm all done, now I don’t want to fall in love again
